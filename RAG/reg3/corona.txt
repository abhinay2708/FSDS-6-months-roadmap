Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, is a highly contagious virus that emerged in late 2019. It primarily spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing, though some people may be asymptomatic.

Preventive measures are essential to reduce transmission, such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, practicing hand hygiene, and getting vaccinated. COVID-19 can lead to severe illness in older adults and people with underlying health conditions.

Governments worldwide have implemented strategies like lockdowns, travel restrictions, and mass vaccination campaigns to control the spread of the virus. Ongoing research continues to improve treatments and vaccines to combat the pandemic effectively.
