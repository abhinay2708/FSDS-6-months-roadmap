    "# List, Tuple, Set and Dictionary Question Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is a list in Python?\n",
    "**Answer:** A list is a dynamic, mutable, ordered collection that can store heterogeneous data types. Internally, Python lists are implemented as dynamic arrays, meaning additional memory is over-allocated to allow efficient appending. Lists preserve insertion order, support indexing, slicing, iteration, and allow operations such as insertions, deletions, and concatenation. They are widely used due to their flexibility and ease of manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. How do you create a list?\n",
    "**Answer:** Lists are created using square brackets, e.g., `a = [1, 2, 3]`. They can contain mixed data types and even nested structures like other lists. Lists can also be created using constructors like `list(iterable)` or via list comprehensions, which provide a concise way to generate lists programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Difference between append() and extend()?\n",
    "**Answer:** `append(x)` adds the entire object `x` as a single element to the end of the list. `extend(iterable)` iterates over the given iterable and adds each element one by one. Thus, `lst.append([1,2])` results in `[..., [1,2]]`, while `lst.extend([1,2])` results in `[...,1,2]`. Append is for single elements; extend is for adding collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Difference between remove() and pop()?\n",
    "**Answer:** `remove(value)` deletes the first occurrence of the specified value and raises an error if the value does not exist. `pop(index)` removes and returns the element at the specified index (default last). pop is index-based and returns the removed element; remove is value-based and returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. How do you check if an element exists in a list?\n",
    "**Answer:** Use the `in` keyword, e.g., `if x in lst`. This performs a linear search through the elements of the list. Membership checks in lists are O(n), meaning performance decreases as the list grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What is list slicing?\n",
    "**Answer:** List slicing allows extracting a portion of a list using the format `list[start:end:step]`. It returns a new list without modifying the original one. Slicing supports negative indices and steps, including reverse slicing like `lst[::-1]` to reverse the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What is a nested list?\n",
    "**Answer:** A nested list is a list that contains other lists as elements. This allows representing matrices, tables, and hierarchical data. Accessing elements involves multiple indexing steps, e.g., `lst[0][1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Difference between list and array (NumPy)?\n",
    "**Answer:** A Python list can store mixed data types and is flexible but inefficient for numerical operations. NumPy arrays store homogeneous data types, support vectorized operations, use contiguous memory, and enable fast mathematical computations. Arrays are preferred in data science and ML workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. What is a list comprehension?\n",
    "**Answer:** A list comprehension provides a concise way to create lists using `[expression for item in iterable]`. It is faster and cleaner than traditional loops and supports conditional filtering. It improves readability and allows efficient generation of transformed lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. How do you remove duplicates from a list?\n",
    "**Answer:** The simplest method is converting it to a set and back: `list(set(lst))`, but this loses order. To preserve order, use a loop or dict: `list(dict.fromkeys(lst))`. Sets remove duplicates because they enforce uniqueness using hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. How do you sort a list?\n",
    "**Answer:** Use `list.sort()` to sort in place or `sorted(list)` to return a new sorted list. Both support parameters like `reverse=True` and `key=function`. Sorting uses Timsort, a hybrid sorting algorithm optimized for real-world data patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. Difference between sorted() and list.sort()?\n",
    "**Answer:** `sorted()` creates and returns a new sorted list without modifying the original. `list.sort()` sorts the list in place and returns None. sorted is more flexible; sort is slightly faster since no new list is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. What happens if you modify a list while iterating?\n",
    "**Answer:** Modifying a list (adding/removing elements) during iteration can lead to skipped elements, duplication, or unexpected behavior because iteration uses an internal index. It is recommended to iterate over a copy using `for x in lst[:]` or use list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. What is shallow copy vs deep copy?\n",
    "**Answer:** A shallow copy copies references of nested objects, meaning changes inside nested structures reflect in both copies. Deep copy recursively copies all nested objects, creating an entirely independent clone. Use `copy.copy()` for shallow, `copy.deepcopy()` for deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. Why are lists slower than sets for membership lookup?\n",
    "**Answer:** Lists perform linear search (O(n)) to check membership, scanning each element sequentially. Sets use hash tables, enabling O(1) average membership lookup. Thus, for large collections, sets are significantly faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. What is a tuple?\n",
    "**Answer:** Tuples are immutable, ordered sequences used to store fixed collections of items. They support indexing, iteration, and unpacking. Tuples are memory-efficient and often used for representing structured data such as coordinates or database records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17. Difference between list and tuple?\n",
    "**Answer:** Lists are mutable and allow changes; tuples are immutable and fixed in size after creation. Tuples are faster, more memory-efficient, and suitable for data that should not be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18. How do you create a tuple with one element?\n",
    "**Answer:** A single-element tuple must include a trailing comma: `(5,)`. Without the comma, Python treats it as a normal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19. Why are tuples immutable?\n",
    "**Answer:** Immutability improves performance, thread-safety, and hashability. Tuples can be stored as dictionary keys because they cannot change after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20. How do you access tuple elements?\n",
    "**Answer:** Tuple elements are accessed using indexing like `t[0]`. Negative indexing and slicing are also supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 21. Can a tuple contain mutable objects?\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes, tuples can contain mutable objects like lists. The tuple itself cannot change, but the objects inside it may be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 22. How does tuple unpacking work?\n",
    "**Answer:** Tuple unpacking allows assigning tuple elements to variables in a single statement: `a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23. What is packing and unpacking in tuples?\n",
    "**Answer:** Packing refers to creating a tuple from multiple values; unpacking splits the tuple into variables. It improves code readability and simplifies multi-value returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 24. Why are tuples faster than lists?\n",
    "**Answer:** Tuples are stored more compactly and avoid dynamic resizing overhead. This makes accessing tuple elements faster compared to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 25. When should you use a tuple instead of a list?\n",
    "**Answer:** Use tuples when data must remain constant, such as configuration values, coordinates, or keys in dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26. Can a tuple be modified indirectly?\n",
    "**Answer:** If a tuple contains mutable objects (like a list), those objects can be modified. The tuple’s structure is fixed, but its contents may still change indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 27. Why can tuples be used as dictionary keys?\n",
    "**Answer:** Dictionary keys must be hashable and immutable. Because tuples cannot change, they provide stable hash values, making them safe for use as keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 28. What is a set?\n",
    "**Answer:** Sets are unordered collections of unique elements implemented using hash tables. They automatically eliminate duplicates and provide fast lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 29. How is a set different from a list?\n",
    "**Answer:** Lists are ordered, allow duplicates, and support indexing. Sets are unordered, enforce uniqueness, and do not support indexing. Sets are optimized for fast membership testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 30. Why does a set not allow duplicates?\n",
    "**Answer:** Because sets use hashing. Each value must produce a unique hash, and if a hash collision occurs, Python handles it but ensures uniqueness at the logical level. Duplicate elements simply overwrite existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 31. How do you create an empty set?\n",
    "**Answer:** Use `set()`. Writing `{}` creates an empty dictionary, not a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32. What happens if you add a duplicate element in a set?\n",
    "**Answer:** Nothing changes—if the element already exists, the set remains the same because it enforces uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 33. remove() vs discard()?\n",
    "**Answer:** `remove()` deletes an element but raises an error if it doesn’t exist. `discard()` deletes an element but does nothing if the element is missing. discard is safer for uncertain membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 34. What are set operations?\n",
    "**Answer:** Union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. These operations allow powerful data comparison and filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 35. How do you find common elements between two lists using sets?\n",
    "**Answer:** Convert lists to sets and use intersection: `set(a) & set(b)` which gives common elements efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 36. Why are sets faster than lists for lookup?\n",
    "**Answer:** Because sets use hash tables, they provide average O(1) lookup, while lists must scan sequentially (O(n)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 37. Can a set contain a list?\n",
    "**Answer:** No. Lists are mutable and unhashable, so they cannot be stored in sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38. What is a frozenset?\n",
    "**Answer:** A frozenset is an immutable version of a set. It can be used as a dictionary key or stored inside another set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39. Can a set be used as a dictionary key?\n",
    "**Answer:** No, because sets are mutable. Only frozensets can be dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 40. What is the time complexity of set lookup?\n",
    "**Answer:** O(1) on average due to hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41. Why are sets unordered?\n",
    "**Answer:** Because hash tables do not maintain order; insertion order is irrelevant for set operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 42. What happens when you try to index a set?\n",
    "**Answer:** An error occurs because sets do not support indexing. You must iterate over them or convert to a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 43. What is a dictionary?\n",
    "**Answer:** Dictionaries are key-value mappings implemented as hash tables. They allow fast lookups, insertions, deletions, and support heterogenous keys and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 44. How are keys and values stored in a dictionary?\n",
    "**Answer:** Dictionaries use hashing to map keys to memory locations. Keys are hashed to determine their position in the table. Collisions are handled using open addressing or chaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 45. Can dictionary keys be duplicated?\n",
    "**Answer:** No. Keys must be unique. If a duplicate key is inserted, the value is overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 46. Can dictionary values be duplicated?\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes. Values may repeat because they are not constrained by uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 47. How do you access dictionary elements?\n",
    "**Answer:** Using `dict[key]` retrieves the corresponding value. Dot notation is not supported unless using special objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 48. Difference between {} and dict()?\n",
    "**Answer:** `{}` creates an empty dictionary. `dict()` is a constructor that also supports keyword arguments like `dict(a=1,b=2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49. get() vs [] for accessing keys?\n",
    "**Answer:** `get(key)` returns a default value (or None) if the key is missing. `dict[key]` raises a KeyError for missing keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 50. How do you iterate over keys and values?\n",
    "**Answer:** Use `for key, value in dict.items()` to loop over pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 51. What is dictionary comprehension?\n",
    "**Answer:** A shorthand for creating dictionaries such as `{x: x*x for x in range(5)}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 52. How do you merge two dictionaries?\n",
    "**Answer:** Use `d1 | d2` (Python 3.9+) or `{**d1, **d2}` for merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 53. What happens if a key already exists when inserting?\n",
    "**Answer:** The new value overwrites the previous one, since keys must be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 54. Difference between pop() and popitem()?\n",
    "**Answer:** `pop(key)` removes a specific key. `popitem()` removes the last inserted key-value pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 55. Why must dictionary keys be immutable?\n",
    "**Answer:** Keys must be immutable so their hash value remains constant. This ensures reliable lookup in hash tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 56. Are dictionaries ordered in Python?\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes. Since Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain insertion order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 57. Time complexity of dictionary lookup?\n",
    "**Answer:** O(1) average time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 58. How do you sort a dictionary by key?\n",
    "**Answer:** Use `sorted(d.items())` which returns sorted key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 59. How do you sort a dictionary by value?\n",
    "**Answer:** Use `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 60. Can you store a list as a dictionary key?\n",
    "**Answer:** No. Lists are mutable and unhashable, so they cannot serve as dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 61. What is hashing in dictionaries?\n",
    "**Answer:** Hashing converts a key into a fixed-size integer used to compute the index in the hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 62. What will be the output of d = {'a':1}; d['a']=d.get('a',0)+1?\n",
    "**Answer:** The dictionary becomes `{'a': 2}` because the value is incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 63. Why are dictionaries heavily used in ML preprocessing?\n",
    "**Answer:** Dictionaries provide fast lookups for tasks like label encoding, token mapping, vocabulary creation, category-to-index mappings, and hyperparameter storage. They are essential because ML preprocessing often requires mapping raw values to encoded numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 64. Why are sets useful in feature engineering?\n",
    "**Answer:** Sets automatically eliminate duplicates and allow fast membership testing. They are ideal for getting unique features, deduplicating data, grouping items, and performing set operations like intersections between feature lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65. Why does Pandas use NumPy arrays internally?\n",
    "**Answer:** Pandas uses NumPy arrays because they provide contiguous memory storage, vectorization, fast operations, and efficient integration with C-level numerical libraries. This results in extremely fast computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 66. How would you count word frequency in text using dictionary?\n",
    "**Answer:** Iterate through each word and update counts using `freq[word] = freq.get(word, 0) + 1`. This approach is efficient due to dictionary O(1) updates and lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 67. Which DS is best for removing duplicates?\n",
    "**Answer:** A set is best because it automatically removes duplicates using hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 68. Which DS is best for fast lookup?\n",
    "**Answer:** Sets and dictionaries provide O(1) lookup using hash tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 69. Which DS maintains order?\n",
    "**Answer:** Lists, tuples, and dictionaries (Python 3.7+) maintain insertion order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 70. Which DS stores immutable records?\n",
    "**Answer:** Tuples store immutable records and are suitable for fixed data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 71. List vs Tuple vs Set vs Dictionary (one-line)?\n",
    "**Answer:** List=ordered mutable, Tuple=ordered immutable, Set=unordered unique, Dict=key-value mapping.\n",
